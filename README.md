# Cybernetic Site


## Project Description

This is a modern, interactive website that showcases a cybernetic and high-tech design aesthetic. The site is built to be visually captivating and technically robust, featuring a series of dynamic animations and effects. The design language is consistent across all sections, using a cool-toned palette of blues and cyans with a focus on digital and futuristic visuals.

## Features

-   **Digital Glitch Hero Section:** The main landing section features a bold, text-based glitch animation and a subtle, responsive background of animated particles created with an HTML canvas. This provides a dramatic and memorable first impression.
-   **Holographic Projects Section:** Projects are displayed in a responsive grid of "holographic shard" cards. Each card uses a unique skew effect and a beautiful light-sweep animation on hover, creating an elegant and interactive user experience.
-   **Glitching Circuit Board API Section:** An SVG-based visualization of a data pipeline with a geometric, circuit board design. Interactive nodes pulse and paths "glitch" rhythmically, giving a sense of a living, active system.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The entire website is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops, using Tailwind CSS and responsive media queries.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure of the site.
-   **CSS3:** Custom styles and keyframe animations for the glitch and hover effects.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers the dynamic canvas background and interactive node behaviors.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for a responsive, utility-first approach to styling.
